4.1 [[Euler Explicit]]
			- General Pendulam on a cart steps #followthecode [[pendulam_on_cart.py]]
				- Define the system properties 
					- mass, inertia tensor 
					- the intial condtions 
				- Create the necessay multibody by calling the System class [1]
				- add the cart via linear guidance 
				- To above system class [1] add the cart (via linear guidance) and the pendulum (via revolute joint) and gravity (via Force)
				- _assemble_ the above using the assemble function of System class [1]
 - Implementations of Mass Matrix M(q) and generalized forces h(t,q,u) as python functions  
- Simulation 
	- initialization of solver
		- the time step 
		- final time 
	- Call the solver with the assembled system the discrite timestep and the final time.
