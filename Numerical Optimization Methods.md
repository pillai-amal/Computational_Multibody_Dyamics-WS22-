[[Gradient Desent]]
[[Newton's Method]]

[[Trapezoidal Implicit Method ]] : numerical method solve _Diffrential Equations_ . It is called [[implicit]] because of the use of formula involving the the value at current set and the nextstep. #secondorder methos ==> higher accuracy. I can be computaionally expensive but stable. 



```dataview
table from #secondorder
